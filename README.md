# Self-Hosting

First, clone the repository locally, and run `yarn` to install packages. Afterwards, run `yarn build` to build a production build and `yarn start` to start hosting it.

Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and configure an admin password. This will be the password used for `/admin`, which is where you can upload data from the website manually.

Currently, the main page is blank, so you must access the subpages by manually going to them.
